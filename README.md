## 📖 About
**Prayly** is a platform designed to foster spiritual support. It allows users to post prayer requests, receive notifications when others are praying for them, and track "Praise Reports" when prayers are answered.

This project demonstrates a robust full-stack architecture using a **Java Spring Boot** backend to handle RESTful APIs and business logic, coupled with a reactive **Vue.js** frontend for a seamless user experience, all powered by a **PostgreSQL** database.

## ✨ Features
- **Create & Manage Requests:** Users can post public or anonymous prayer requests.
- **Intercession Button:** A "Pray" button that increments a counter and notifies the requester.
- **Feed Filtering:** Filter requests by category (Healing, Guidance, Family, etc.) or recency.
- **User Dashboard:** View your prayer history and requests you are following.
- **Praise Reports:** Mark requests as "Answered" and share the story.
